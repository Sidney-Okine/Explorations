New Wide camera captures 47% more light for better photos and videos

New sensor-shift optical image stabilization keeps shots steady even when you’re not

Superbright

Our OLED display gets 28 percent brighter, up to 800 nits, so it’s easier to see in full sunlight. And it still goes up to 1200 nits for HDR content. You’ll notice bright whites, true blacks, and every shade in between. Yet the display conserves power better than ever.
Supercolorful

iPhone 13 features a cinema standard wide color gamut, displaying colors just as filmmakers intended. And with precise color accuracy, everything on the screen looks remarkably natural.
Supersharp

The Super Retina XDR display has an ultrahigh pixel density, so photos, videos, text — whatever you’re viewing — looks extra-sharp. And the display is even more expansive, thanks to a smaller TrueDepth camera area.
A15 Bionic is a game-changing chip.

The lightning-fast A15 Bionic powers Cinematic mode, Photographic Styles, Live Text, and more. Its Secure Enclave locks down personal info like your Face ID data and contacts. And it’s more efficient, helping to deliver longer battery life.

    Driven by premium sound
    Beats was born to deliver music as the artist intended. Beats Studio Buds are engineered to deliver powerful, balanced sound in a compact design, through an entirely customized acoustic platform. A proprietary, dual-element diaphragm driver resides within a two-chamber housing, resulting in clear sound with outstanding stereo separation. An advanced digital processor then optimizes audio performance for loudness and clarity, while simultaneously ensuring clean noise-cancellation. The result — immersive sound that pulls the emotion of music from the studio to your ears to keep you going all day long.

    Control the noise
    With two distinct listening modes, you are in total control of your sound. Active Noise Cancelling (ANC) continuously blocks unwanted outside noise using a finely-tuned filter that dynamically adapts to your surroundings. When you need to hear the world around you, switch to Transparency mode at the press of a button. The external-facing microphones mix the sounds of your surroundings back in with your music for a natural, ‘open’ listening experience.

    Power your day
    The earbuds have up to 8 hours of listening time¹ with two additional charges provided by its pocket-sized charging case.² That means that Beats Studio Buds give you up to 24 hours of combined playback. With ANC or Transparency mode turned on, you’ll get up to 5 hours of listening time, 15 combined with the case. If you need a little extra juice, 5-minute Fast Fuel charging gives up to 1 hour of playback³ when battery is low. Now that’s wireless freedom.

    Choose your fit
    Three soft, silicone eartip sizes (small, medium, or large) give you a customized fit and create an acoustic seal for an even more immersive listening experience. These size options provide comfort, stability, and the confidence of staying put. Beats Studio Buds were made to fit seamlessly into your life with its sleek, compact in-ear design. Its matching charging case offers superior portability with a rounded, slim design that easily fits in your pocket or purse. Even better, the earbuds themselves offer an IPX4 rating for sweat and water resistance.⁴

    Keep the connection
    With Class 1 Bluetooth® technology, Beats Studio Buds offer extended wireless range and fewer dropouts. Dual-beam forming microphones target your voice and filter out wind and external noise for high-quality call performance and elevated voice clarity. On-ear controls allow you to manage calls and control music. You’ll also be able to customize the “Press and Hold” function to work for either ANC or your voice assistant.⁵

    Compatible with Apple and Android
    Beats Studio Buds feature simple one-touch pairing for Apple⁶ and Android devices⁷ and easily connect via Bluetooth. With the Beats app for Android, you’ll get features like built-in controls, device status (i.e. battery levels), and firmware updates. With Apple devices, those features are built in to iOS with no app required, and you can also activate Siri hands-free just by saying “Hey Siri”.⁸ And the USB-C charge connector provides a single charging solution across both Apple and Android platforms.

From deep, rich bass to accurate mids and crisp, clean highs, you’ll hear every note with a new sense of clarity.
    
    Immersive listening
    To cancel unwanted external sound, AirPods Max use a total of six outward-facing microphones to detect noise in your environment, and two inward-facing microphones to measure what you’re hearing. Beamforming microphones help isolate your voice on phone calls, so it’s heard clearly — even in windy situations.
    
    Distortionless playback

    Warmer. Hot.
    If your AirTag is nearby, your iPhone can lead you straight to it with Precision Finding.1 You‘ll see the distance to your AirTag and the direction to head in — all thanks to Ultra Wideband technology.
    
    Get by with a little help from hundreds of millions of friends.
    When youʼve left something far behind, like at the beach or the gym, the Find My network — hundreds of millions of iPhone, iPad, and Mac devices around the world — helps track down your AirTag. And itʼs designed to protect your privacy every step of the way.
    
    How does it work?
    Your AirTag sends out a secure Bluetooth signal that can be detected by nearby devices in the Find My network. These devices send the location of your AirTag to iCloud — then you can go to the Find My app and see it on a map. The whole process is anonymous and encrypted to protect your privacy. And itʼs efficient, so thereʼs no need to worry about battery life or data usage.
    
    Lost Mode makes finding things
    even easier.
    Just like your other Apple devices, AirTag can be put into Lost Mode. Then, when it’s detected by a device in the network, you’ll automatically get a notification. You can also set it so someone can get your contact info by tapping your AirTag with an NFC-capable smartphone — that’s the same technology that lets people pay for things with their phones.
    
    Privacy is built in.
    Only you can see where your AirTag is. Your location data and history are never stored on the AirTag itself. Devices that relay the location of your AirTag also stay anonymous, and that location data is encrypted every step of the way. So not even Apple knows the location of your AirTag or the identity of the device that helps find it.

    AirTag is designed to discourage unwanted tracking. If someone else’s AirTag finds its way into your stuff, your iPhone will notice it’s traveling with you and send you an alert. After a while, if you still haven’t found it, the AirTag will start playing a sound to let you know it’s there.

    Of course, if you happen to be with a friend who has an AirTag, or on a train with a whole bunch of people with AirTag, don’t worry. These alerts are triggered only when an AirTag is separated from its owner.
    
    Beautifully simple.
    A one-tap setup instantly connects your AirTag with your iPhone or iPad. Enter a name for your AirTag, attach it to the item you want to track, and youʼre good to go. Want AirTag notifications on your Apple Watch, too? No problem.

    All-new with Spatial Audio. With spatial audio that places sound all around you, Adaptive EQ that tunes music to your ears,and longer battery life that charges up in a snap.
    Spatial audio with dynamic head tracking places sounds all around you to create a three-dimensional listening experience for music, TV shows, movies, and more — immersing you in sounds from every direction so it feels like you’re in your very own concert hall or theater.
    Bass hits an all-time high.
    An Apple-designed dynamic driver, powered by a custom amplifier, renders music in exceptionally detailed sound quality — so you revel in every tone, from deep, rich bass to crisp, clean highs.
    Music on a more personal note. Adaptive EQ automatically tunes music to your ears. Inward-facing microphones detect what you’re hearing, then adjust low- and mid-range frequencies to deliver the rich details in every song, customized for you in real time.
    Mute the breeze.
    Covered in a special acoustic mesh, an inset microphone in each earbud minimizes wind noise when you’re on a call — so your voice is always heard loud and clear.
    You heard it here first. HD voice quality for FaceTime. Connect on FaceTime in crisp, HD quality with a new AAC-ELD speech codec. And with support for spatial audio, Group FaceTime calls sound more true to life than ever.
    Style from ear to ear. With a contoured design and shorter stem, AirPods are designed to direct sound into your ears — in a refined look anyone can appreciate.
    Pinch-perfect control.
    The force sensor gives you even more control over your entertainment. You can press to play, pause, and skip through songs, or answer and end calls.
    
    It shrugs off sweat and sprinkles,and delivers an experience that’s simply magical.
    Both AirPods and the MagSafe Charging Case are rated IPX4 sweat and water resistant, so they’ll withstand anything from rain to heavy workouts.
    A case full of energy. Wirelessly and effortlessly recharge the MagSafe Charging Case on a MagSafe charger.3 Fully loaded, the case gives you up to 30 hours of total listening time.4 And charging AirPods in the case for just 5 minutes generates around an hour of listening time

    This extraordinary design is only possible thanks to M1, the first system on a chip for Mac. It makes iMac so thin and compact that it fits in more places than ever.
    M1 integrates the processor, graphics, memory, and more onto a single chip. That let us put an entire computer into a space so small it practically disappears.
    
    A perfectly poised stand. And blazingly fast Thunderbolt ports.
    
    A power connector that easily attaches via magnets. With a color-matched woven cable.

    See the big picture. And all the details.

    See it all in sharp, glorious detail on the immersive 24‑inch 4.5K Retina display.2 The P3 wide color gamut brings what you’re watching to life in over a billion colors. Images shine with a brilliant 500 nits of brightness. Industry-leading anti‑reflective coating delivers greater comfort and readability. And True Tone technology automatically adjusts the color temperature of your display to the ambient light of your environment, for a more natural viewing experience. So whether you’re editing photos, working on presentations, or watching your favorite shows and movies, everything looks incredible on iMac.
    
    1080p FaceTime HD camera.
    Ready for your close-up.

    It’s the best camera system ever in a Mac. Double the resolution for higher-quality video calls.3 A larger sensor that captures more light. And the advanced image signal processor (ISP) of M1 greatly improves image quality. So from collaborating with coworkers to catching up with friends and family, you’ll always look your best.

    Studio-quality mics.
    For high-quality conversations.

    Whether you’re on a video call with a friend, cutting a track, or recording a podcast, the microphones on iMac make sure you come through loud, crisp, and clear. The studio-quality three-mic array is designed to reduce feedback, so conversations flow more naturally and you interrupt each other less. And beamforming technology helps the mics ignore background noise. Which means everyone hears you — not what’s going on around you.
    
    Six-speaker sound system.
    Audio that really fills a room.
    
    The sound system on iMac brings incredible, room-filling audio to any space. Two pairs of force-cancelling woofers create rich, deep bass without unwanted vibrations. And each pair is balanced with a high-performance tweeter. The result is a massive, detailed soundstage that takes your movies, music, and more to the next level.
    
    M1 and Monterey.
    With great power comes great capability.

    M1 is the most powerful chip we’ve ever made. macOS Monterey is the most advanced desktop operating system in the world. Combined, they take iMac to entirely new levels of performance, efficiency, and security. iMac wakes from sleep almost instantly, apps launch in a flash, and the whole system feels fluid, smooth, and snappy. With up to 85 percent faster CPU performance and up to two times faster graphics performance than standard 21.5‑inch iMac models, you can use apps like Xcode and Affinity Photo to compile code in a fraction of the time or edit photos in real time.4 And it runs cool and quiet even while tackling these intense workloads. That’s the power of hardware, software, and silicon — all designed together.

    Driven by premium sound
    Beats was born to deliver music as the artist intended. Beats Studio Buds are engineered to deliver powerful, balanced sound in a compact design, through an entirely customized acoustic platform. A proprietary, dual-element diaphragm driver resides within a two-chamber housing, resulting in clear sound with outstanding stereo separation. An advanced digital processor then optimizes audio performance for loudness and clarity, while simultaneously ensuring clean noise-cancellation. The result — immersive sound that pulls the emotion of music from the studio to your ears to keep you going all day long.

    Control the noise
    With two distinct listening modes, you are in total control of your sound. Active Noise Cancelling (ANC) continuously blocks unwanted outside noise using a finely-tuned filter that dynamically adapts to your surroundings. When you need to hear the world around you, switch to Transparency mode at the press of a button. The external-facing microphones mix the sounds of your surroundings back in with your music for a natural, ‘open’ listening experience.

    Power your day
    The earbuds have up to 8 hours of listening time¹ with two additional charges provided by its pocket-sized charging case.² That means that Beats Studio Buds give you up to 24 hours of combined playback. With ANC or Transparency mode turned on, you’ll get up to 5 hours of listening time, 15 combined with the case. If you need a little extra juice, 5-minute Fast Fuel charging gives up to 1 hour of playback³ when battery is low. Now that’s wireless freedom.

    Choose your fit
    Three soft, silicone eartip sizes (small, medium, or large) give you a customized fit and create an acoustic seal for an even more immersive listening experience. These size options provide comfort, stability, and the confidence of staying put. Beats Studio Buds were made to fit seamlessly into your life with its sleek, compact in-ear design. Its matching charging case offers superior portability with a rounded, slim design that easily fits in your pocket or purse. Even better, the earbuds themselves offer an IPX4 rating for sweat and water resistance.⁴

    Keep the connection
    With Class 1 Bluetooth® technology, Beats Studio Buds offer extended wireless range and fewer dropouts. Dual-beam forming microphones target your voice and filter out wind and external noise for high-quality call performance and elevated voice clarity. On-ear controls allow you to manage calls and control music. You’ll also be able to customize the “Press and Hold” function to work for either ANC or your voice assistant.⁵

    Compatible with Apple and Android
    Beats Studio Buds feature simple one-touch pairing for Apple⁶ and Android devices⁷ and easily connect via Bluetooth. With the Beats app for Android, you’ll get features like built-in controls, device status (i.e. battery levels), and firmware updates. With Apple devices, those features are built in to iOS with no app required, and you can also activate Siri hands-free just by saying “Hey Siri”.⁸ And the USB-C charge connector provides a single charging solution across both Apple and Android platforms.

    High-Fidelity Audio The Apple-designed driver delivers high-fidelity playback with ultra-low distortion across the entire audible range.
    The canopy spanning the headband is made from a breathable knit mesh, distributing weight to reduce on‑head pressure.The stainless steel frame is wrapped with a soft-to-the-touch material for a remarkable combination of strength, flexibility, and comfort.

    Crafted with acoustically engineered memory foam, the ear cushions gently create an immersive seal that is the foundation of incredible sound.
    
    Sounds like an epiphany.
    AirPods Max combine high-fidelity audio with industry-leading Active Noise Cancellation to deliver an unparalleled listening experience. Each part of their custom-built driver works to produce sound with ultra-low distortion across the audible range. From deep, rich bass to accurate mids and crisp, clean highs, you’ll hear every note with a new sense of clarity.
    
    Immersive listening
    To cancel unwanted external sound, AirPods Max use a total of six outward-facing microphones to detect noise in your environment, and two inward-facing microphones to measure what you’re hearing. Beamforming microphones help isolate your voice on phone calls, so it’s heard clearly — even in windy situations.
    
    Distortionless playback
    Modeled after those in high-end floor-standing speakers, the driver’s dual-neodymium ring magnet motor minimizes total harmonic distortion across the entire audible range. The result is consistently clear playback, even at full volume.

    Boundary-pushing computational audio creates the full, detailed tones of a much larger speaker — and HomePod mini turns it up without missing your voice commands.
    
    HomePod mini is designed to fit anywhere in the house. Its elegant shape is wrapped in a perfectly seamless mesh fabric that’s virtually transparent to the sound passing through it. A backlit touch surface on the top provides quick control.
    
    With multiple HomePod mini speakers placed around the house, you can have a connected sound system for your whole home.1 Ask Siri to play one song everywhere or, just as easily, a different song in each room.
    
    Having powerful audio everywhere in the house couldn‘t be simpler — and each HomePod mini gives you total control, no matter where you are. HomePod mini also works with your Apple devices for features like Intercom, letting you quickly communicate by voice.
    
    Pick up an incoming call from your iPhone, kick back with your favorite shows on Apple TV, listen to music on your Mac — HomePod mini works effortlessly with all your Apple devices and experiences to take your sound to the next level. You can even create a stereo pair — two HomePod mini speakers paired in the same room create left and right channels for fully immersive audio.
    
    If you’re enjoying music or a podcast and have to head out, you can continue to listen on your iPhone without missing a beat. Hand it off simply by bringing your iPhone close to HomePod mini. You’ll experience the feeling of your iPhone and HomePod mini connecting virtually as the sound transfers.
    
    Personalized listening suggestions will also automatically appear on your iPhone when you hold it next to HomePod mini. You’ll have instant control at your fingertips without having to unlock your iPhone.
    
    Siri is your do-it-all intelligent assistant that puts HomePod mini at the center of your family’s activities. And with multiple HomePod mini speakers around the house, it‘s easy to call on Siri from anywhere. HomePod mini and Siri can do even more by seamlessly connecting to your iPhone, and Apple Music Voice gives you access to every song in the catalog — all with just your voice.
    
    Siri can recognize the voices of up to six different family members on HomePod mini — and create a personalized experience for each person. So the music Dad hears when he asks for something he’d like is totally different from what the kids hear when they ask. And with Personal Requests, Siri can recognize a particular voice and relay that person’s information from iPhone apps like Messages, Calendar, Reminders, and Contacts.6 And of course, HomePod mini keeps your information private and secure.
    
    Intercom spreads the word.
    With more than one HomePod mini in the house, you can easily communicate with your family members by voice using Intercom. Ask Siri to send your message to the whole house or to individual rooms — and everyone can easily respon

    High Frame Rate HDR.2
    It’s a game changer.

    Adjusting your television settings to get the best picture quality can be frustrating. Not anymore. Apple TV 4K now works with your iPhone to automatically calibrate what you watch.

    All the best TV.
    And it shows.

    Ping it. Find it.
    Misplacing something like your wallet doesn’t have to be a big deal when it has AirTag attached. You can play a sound on the built-in speaker by going to the new Items tab in the Find My app, or say “Hey Siri, find my wallet.” If it’s hiding nearby — like under the couch or in the next room — just follow the sound and your search is over.
    
    Cold. Warm.
    Warmer. Hot.
    If your AirTag is nearby, your iPhone can lead you straight to it with Precision Finding.1 You‘ll see the distance to your AirTag and the direction to head in — all thanks to Ultra Wideband technology.
    
    Get by with a little help from hundreds of millions of friends.
    When youʼve left something far behind, like at the beach or the gym, the Find My network — hundreds of millions of iPhone, iPad, and Mac devices around the world — helps track down your AirTag. And itʼs designed to protect your privacy every step of the way.
    
    How does it work?
    Your AirTag sends out a secure Bluetooth signal that can be detected by nearby devices in the Find My network. These devices send the location of your AirTag to iCloud — then you can go to the Find My app and see it on a map. The whole process is anonymous and encrypted to protect your privacy. And itʼs efficient, so thereʼs no need to worry about battery life or data usage.
    
    Lost Mode makes finding things
    even easier.
    Just like your other Apple devices, AirTag can be put into Lost Mode. Then, when it’s detected by a device in the network, you’ll automatically get a notification. You can also set it so someone can get your contact info by tapping your AirTag with an NFC-capable smartphone — that’s the same technology that lets people pay for things with their phones.
    
    Privacy is built in.
    Only you can see where your AirTag is. Your location data and history are never stored on the AirTag itself. Devices that relay the location of your AirTag also stay anonymous, and that location data is encrypted every step of the way. So not even Apple knows the location of your AirTag or the identity of the device that helps find it.

    AirTag is designed to discourage unwanted tracking. If someone else’s AirTag finds its way into your stuff, your iPhone will notice it’s traveling with you and send you an alert. After a while, if you still haven’t found it, the AirTag will start playing a sound to let you know it’s there.

    Of course, if you happen to be with a friend who has an AirTag, or on a train with a whole bunch of people with AirTag, don’t worry. These alerts are triggered only when an AirTag is separated from its owner.
    
    Beautifully simple.
    A one-tap setup instantly connects your AirTag with your iPhone or iPad. Enter a name for your AirTag, attach it to the item you want to track, and youʼre good to go. Want AirTag notifications on your Apple Watch, too? No problem.

    A radically original composition.
    The over-ear headphone has been completely reimagined. From cushion to canopy, AirPods Max are designed for an uncompromising fit that creates the optimal acoustic seal for many different head shapes — fully immersing you in every sound.
    
    High-Fidelity Audio The Apple-designed driver delivers high-fidelity playback with ultra-low distortion across the entire audible range.
    The canopy spanning the headband is made from a breathable knit mesh, distributing weight to reduce on‑head pressure.The stainless steel frame is wrapped with a soft-to-the-touch material for a remarkable combination of strength, flexibility, and comfort.
    
    Telescoping arms smoothly extend and stay where you set them, for a consistent fit and seal.
    
    The beautifully anodized aluminum cups feature a revolutionary mechanism that allows each cup to rotate independently and balance pressure.
    
    Crafted with acoustically engineered memory foam, the ear cushions gently create an immersive seal that is the foundation of incredible sound.
    
    Sounds like an epiphany.
    AirPods Max combine high-fidelity audio with industry-leading Active Noise Cancellation to deliver an unparalleled listening experience. Each part of their custom-built driver works to produce sound with ultra-low distortion across the audible range. From deep, rich bass to accurate mids and crisp, clean highs, you’ll hear every note with a new sense of clarity.
    
    Immersive listening
    To cancel unwanted external sound, AirPods Max use a total of six outward-facing microphones to detect noise in your environment, and two inward-facing microphones to measure what you’re hearing. Beamforming microphones help isolate your voice on phone calls, so it’s heard clearly — even in windy situations.
    
    Distortionless playback
    Modeled after those in high-end floor-standing speakers, the driver’s dual-neodymium ring magnet motor minimizes total harmonic distortion across the entire audible range. The result is consistently clear playback, even at full volume.
